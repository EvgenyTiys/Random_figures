# Random_figures
The tool is designed to explore the boundary between the world of physics and the world of esotericism. The tool is designed to refute esoteric ideas about people's ability to predict the future and to help people with clairvoyance prove the opposite. The experiment is based on mathematical statistics to confirm the existence of weak effects of direct foresight. People who, for whatever reason, believe they possess some degree of clairvoyance are allowed to participate in the experiment. If clairvoyance exists, the experiment should show the presence of a second peak in the distribution, significantly different from the deviation that could be observed for random reasons.

The user registers on the website and attempts to guess the shape stored in the database 20 times. To motivate participants, a cash prize can be offered for guessing correctly after more than a certain number of attempts. In this case, the number of participants or the prize fund should be limited.
